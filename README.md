## Chess Competition Code

The CGame file includes code that allows you to play two chess-playing algorithms against each other in a tournament style over various board positions to determine which chess-playing algorithm is the best.
The documentation for CGame is included in the file.

# Competition bot

Also included is some of the code I made during a timed competition with friends which shows a basic chess bot using Minimax and my evaluation function. There are still many improvements, especially in a better evaluation function, but it shows what a basic chess bot is like.
